# nocturne-docker
A dockerfile for building the Nocturne image and connector

## Description
This is my first swing at a Docker container to build Nocturne after experiencing dependency hell with WSL Debian. Many thanks to Nebula from the Nocturne Discord for pointing me to using voidlinux as a starting point for this dockerfile. 

## Prerequisites
This dockerfile project was created using Windows 10, with Debian running under WSL.

## How to use locally

1. Clone this repo. Navigate into it.
2. Run `docker build -t nocturne-build-container .` to build the container.
3. Run `docker run -it --privileged nocturne-build-container` to use the container.
4. Inside the container, run `./finish-init.sh`.

From here, you are able to use `git clone` to pull down the Nocturne Connector or Nocturne Image for building. Use `docker cp` to copy out your build images from the container to your local host directory.

âš  Warning: When you first go to build the Nocturne Image, you must insert `sudo` before the `download.sh` command: `cd resources/stock-files && sudo ./download.sh`

## How to use for GitHub actions

GitHub actions does not allow running an image in a privledged state unless you self-host. So to use GitHub Actions, you must pre-build your image and capture the changes of the finish-init.sh and push it.

1. `docker build --platform=linux/arm64 -t nocturne-builder-base .`
2. `docker run --platform=linux/arm64 --privileged --name nocturne-builder-container nocturne-builder-base /home/builder/finish-init.sh`
3. `docker commit nocturne-builder-container nocturne-builder-prebuilt`

Tag for pushing up
1. `docker login ghcr.io -u nguyenkvvn`
    > enter in your token where write:packages is granted
2. `docker tag nocturne-builder-prebuilt ghcr.io/nguyenkvvn/nocturne-builder:latest`
3. `docker push ghcr.io/nguyenkvvn/nocturne-builder:latest`
